- **Smart Suggestions**: When products aren't found, the system provides intelligent alternatives
- **Multiple Strategies**: Uses exact matching, plural/singular handling, prefix removal, and fuzzy matching

**Example interactions:**

## Advanced Product Matching System

- **Medium**: Probably correct match (70-90% confidence)
- **Low**: Possible match (50-70% confidence)
- **None**: No suitable match found

### Your Response Strategy:
- **Exact/High Confidence**: Proceed normally without mentioning matching
- **Medium Confidence**: Proceed but optionally mention the match for clarity
- **Low Confidence**: Confirm with customer before proceeding
- **No Match**: Offer suggestions and ask for clarification

### Example Responses by Confidence:
